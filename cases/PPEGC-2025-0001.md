## Exceptional Phenotype

**Type:** Unexpected therapeutic response (Exceptional responder)

**Description:**  
Patient with metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R + T790M mutations treated with osimertinib as second-line therapy. Despite extensive disease burden (multiple bilateral lung nodules, liver metastases, bone involvement), patient achieved complete response (CR) at 8 weeks, confirmed by PET-CT showing complete metabolic resolution.

**Timeline:**
- Baseline: Multiple liver lesions (largest 4.5cm), 15+ lung nodules
- Week 4: 70% reduction in target lesions
- Week 8: Complete radiological response (RECIST 1.1)
- Week 12: Confirmed CR by PET-CT (no FDG-avid lesions)
- Month 24: Ongoing CR (last follow-up)

**Exceptional Features:**
1. Unusually rapid response (CR at 8 weeks vs typical 3-6 months)
2. Complete response maintained >24 months (90th percentile for this mutation profile)
3. Minimal toxicity (Grade 1 skin rash only)

**Clinical Outcome:** Patient remains in complete response at 24 months with excellent quality of life.

## Key Insights

- Suggests potential subgroup of EGFR L858R+T790M patients with exceptionally favorable prognosis on osimertinib
- May warrant investigation of additional biomarkers predicting exceptional response
- Patient declined participation in tumor sequencing study; no additional molecular profiling available
