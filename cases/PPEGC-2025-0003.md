## Exceptional Phenotype

**Type:** Unusual toxicity

**Description:**  
Patient with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Despite KRAS G12C mutation (typically contraindicating anti-EGFR therapy), cetuximab was added per clinical trial protocol. Patient developed severe, life-threatening toxicity (Grade 4 diarrhea, Grade 4 neutropenia) requiring ICU admission.

**Timeline:**
- Cycle 1, Day 1: FOLFIRI + cetuximab initiated
- Day 5: Onset of severe diarrhea (10+ stools/day)
- Day 7: Febrile neutropenia (ANC 100/μL), hospitalized
- Day 10: ICU admission for septic shock
- Day 15: Recovery, treatment permanently discontinued

**Exceptional Features:**
1. Severity disproportionate to standard FOLFIRI toxicity profile
2. UGT1A1 *28/*28 homozygosity (known irinotecan risk factor)
3. Novel DPYD IVS14+1G>A variant detected retrospectively
4. Combination of two germline pharmacogenomic risk alleles

**Post-Event Pharmacogenomic Analysis:**
- UGT1A1 *28/*28: Associated with severe irinotecan toxicity
- DPYD IVS14+1G>A: Splicing variant, reduced DPD enzyme activity (5-FU metabolism)
- Combined genotype predicted severe toxicity risk

**Clinical Outcome:**  
Patient recovered fully. Switched to capecitabine monotherapy (no further toxicity). Stable disease maintained for 8 months.

## Key Insights

- Highlights importance of pre-treatment pharmacogenomic screening
- First report combining UGT1A1 *28/*28 + DPYD IVS14+1G>A in CRC patient
- Suggests additive toxicity risk with multiple pharmacogenomic variants
- Case contributed to institutional policy change: mandatory DPYD/UGT1A1 testing before FOLFIRI
