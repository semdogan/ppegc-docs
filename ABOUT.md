# About PPEGC

**PRISM Platform for Exceptional Genomic Cancer Cases**

---

## Our Mission

PPEGC is dedicated to advancing precision oncology by transforming isolated clinical observations into actionable scientific knowledge. We collect, curate, and share exceptional cancer cases associated with genomic alterations to identify weak signals, generate biological hypotheses, and improve patient outcomes worldwide.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Exceptional Cases Are Isolated

Oncologists regularly encounter patients with unexpected clinical outcomes:
- Exceptional responders who dramatically benefit from therapies
- Patients with unexplained resistance despite having the "right" biomarker
- Unusual toxicities that suggest novel pharmacogenomic interactions

**These cases are scientifically valuable but typically remain isolated within individual institutions.**

### Current Databases Miss Rare Events

Existing cancer databases (TCGA, COSMIC, cBioPortal) are designed for common patterns and large cohorts. They excel at identifying frequent mutations but struggle to capture:
- Individual exceptional responses
- Context-dependent phenotypes
- Rare genotype-phenotype associations

### Literature Publication Is Too Slow

By the time an exceptional case becomes a published case report (often 12-24 months), the knowledge could have already helped other patients. Moreover, many cases never reach publication due to the effort required.

---

## Our Solution

### Rapid Sharing Platform

PPEGC provides a streamlined workflow:
1. **Simple submission** (less than 5 minutes via structured form)
2. **Fast curation** (7-15 business days)
3. **Immediate publication** (open access)
4. **Citeable** (DOI for academic recognition)

### Structured, Searchable Data

Unlike case reports buried in journal articles, PPEGC cases are:
- Standardized format (easy to search and compare)
- Genomic data in HGVS nomenclature (machine-readable)
- Tagged by cancer type, variant, phenotype (faceted search)
- Exportable for computational analysis

### Privacy-Preserving

We balance data sharing with patient privacy through:
- Mandatory pseudonymization
- Anonymization before publication
- GDPR-compliant infrastructure (HDS-certified hosting)
- Transparent governance

---

## Our History

### 2025: Concept Development

The idea for PPEGC emerged from conversations among oncologists at Gustave Roussy and international partners who recognized the need for a systematic way to share exceptional cases.

### 2026: Platform Launch

PPEGC officially launched for beta-testing in March 2026 with:
- REDCap-based submission system
- GitHub Pages documentation site
- Initial governance framework
- First curated cases

### Future Roadmap

**2026-2027:**
- Expand curation team to cover more cancer types
- Launch searchable case database with filtering
- Develop public API for researchers
- Establish Scientific Advisory Board
- Form Patient Advisory Council
- Publish first impact report

**2027-2028:**
- Machine learning integration for case matching
- Mobile app for easier submissions
- Partnership with electronic health record (EHR) systems
- International network of participating centers

## Our Values

### Open Science

We believe scientific knowledge should be freely accessible. All published cases are released under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0, allowing anyone to use the data with proper attribution.

### Patient Privacy

Patient trust is paramount. We implement rigorous pseudonymization and anonymization protocols, exceeding GDPR requirements.

### Quality Over Quantity

Every case undergoes manual scientific review. We prioritize exceptional, well-documented cases over high submission volumes.

### Global Collaboration

Cancer knows no borders. We welcome contributors from all countries and facilitate international networking.

### Transparency

Our governance, policies, and processes are publicly documented. We're accountable to our community and patients.

### Recognition

Contributors deserve credit. Every published case includes full attribution and a citable DOI.
