## Exceptional Phenotype

**Type:** Unexpected resistance (Primary resistance)

**Description:**  
Patient with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic melanoma showing progressive disease (PD) on vemurafenib despite confirmed V600E mutation. Molecular profiling revealed concurrent PTEN loss-of-function mutation (nonsense mutation R130*), rarely detected at baseline.

**Timeline:**
- Baseline: Multiple liver, lung, and subcutaneous metastases
- Week 4: Increased size of liver lesions (+15%)
- Week 8: New brain metastases, progression in all target lesions (+35%)
- Treatment discontinued, switched to ipilimumab/nivolumab

**Exceptional Features:**
1. Primary resistance to BRAF inhibitor despite canonical V600E mutation
2. PTEN loss detected at baseline (unusual in treatment-naive melanoma)
3. Rapid progression (8 weeks vs typical first progression at 6-9 months)

**Post-Treatment Findings:**
- Subsequent immunotherapy (ipi/nivo): Partial response achieved
- Brain metastases controlled with stereotactic radiosurgery
- Patient alive at 18 months follow-up

**Hypothesis:**  
Concurrent PTEN loss may confer primary resistance to BRAF inhibition via constitutive PI3K/AKT pathway activation, bypassing BRAF dependency.

## Key Insights

- First reported case of PTEN nonsense mutation detected at baseline in BRAF V600E melanoma
- Supports pre-treatment molecular profiling beyond BRAF testing
- Suggests PTEN loss as potential biomarker for primary BRAF inhibitor resistance
- Patient tumor DNA available for collaborative research
