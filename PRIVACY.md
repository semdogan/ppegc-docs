**PPEGC Privacy Policy**

*Platform for Exceptional Genomic Cancer Cases*

Effective Date: February 14, 2026

1\. Introduction

The Platform for Exceptional Genomic Cancer Cases (PPEGC) is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and safeguard personal and health data in compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable national laws.

PPEGC is a scientific research platform dedicated to sharing exceptional oncological cases associated with genomic alterations. All data processing is conducted in accordance with Article 89 of the GDPR, which provides safeguards for research purposes in the public interest.

2\. Data Controller

**Data Controller:**

Gustave Roussy Institute

114 rue Édouard Vaillant

94805 Villejuif, France

Email: *dpo@gustaveroussy.fr*

**Data Protection Officer (DPO):** Contact information available at the email address above.

3\. Legal Basis for Data Processing

PPEGC processes personal data under the following legal bases:

-   **Article 6(1)(e) GDPR:** Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (scientific research in oncology and precision medicine)

-   **Article 9(2)(j) GDPR:** Processing of health data is necessary for scientific research purposes in accordance with Article 89(1)

-   **Article 89 GDPR:** Safeguards for research purposes, including pseudonymization, data minimization, and restricted access

4\. Data Collected

4.1 Patient Data (Pseudonymized)

PPEGC collects pseudonymized clinical and genomic data submitted by healthcare professionals. Data submitted does **[not]{.underline}** include direct patient identifiers (name, date of birth, national health ID, precise address).

**Data collected includes:**

-   Age range (e.g., 60-65 years) or approximate age

-   Sex

-   Cancer type and histology (e.g., metastatic lung adenocarcinoma)

-   Disease stage and treatment lines

-   Specific genomic variants (e.g., EGFR exon 19 deletion) in standardized nomenclature (HGVS)

-   Exceptional clinical phenotype (unexpected response, resistance, or toxicity)

-   Coded submitting center identifier (not the real institution name)

4.2 Contributor Data

Healthcare professionals who submit cases provide professional identification information:

-   Name and professional credentials

-   Professional registration number (RPPS, NPI, or equivalent)

-   Email address

-   Institutional affiliation

5\. How We Use Your Data

Data submitted to PPEGC is used exclusively for scientific research purposes:

-   To identify weak signals and generate biological hypotheses in precision oncology

-   To facilitate international clinical networking and knowledge sharing

-   To curate and validate exceptional cancer cases for publication on the PPEGC platform

-   To enable aggregate statistical analysis across multiple cases

6\. Data Processing and Publication

6.1 Internal Curation Phase

Submitted cases are reviewed by the PPEGC curation team (restricted access) to ensure scientific validity, data quality, and completeness. During this phase (maximum 3 months), pseudonymized data is stored on secure servers hosted at Gustave Roussy, certified as a Health Data Host (HDS) under French law.

6.2 Public Publication

After validation, cases are published on the PPEGC public platform in **anonymized form**. Only the following minimal information is visible:

-   Coded center identifier (never the actual institution name)

-   Cancer type

-   Specific genomic alteration(s)

-   Clinical phenotype (type of exceptional response)

**Important:** Published data is anonymized to the extent that re-identification of individual patients is not reasonably possible. No link is maintained between published cases and the original patient or submitting institution after publication.

7\. Data Storage and Security

7.1 Hosting and Location

All data submitted to PPEGC is hosted on secure infrastructure at Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, within the European Union. Data **[is not transferred]{.underline}** to third countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

7.2 Security Measures

PPEGC implements state-of-the-art technical and organizational measures to protect data:

-   Certified Health Data Host (HDS) infrastructure

-   End-to-end encryption of data in transit and at rest

-   Multi-factor authentication for team access

-   Access logs and audit trails

-   Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

-   Automated and manual backup systems

7.3 Access Control

Access to non-anonymized (pseudonymized) data during the curation phase is restricted to authorized PPEGC team members who have undergone training in data protection and confidentiality. Published data is accessible to the global scientific community.

8\. Data Retention

-   **Curation phase:** Pseudonymized data is retained for a maximum of 3 months during the review and validation process.

-   **Published data:** Anonymized cases are retained indefinitely for scientific and archival purposes, as they no longer constitute personal data under GDPR.

9\. Your Rights Under GDPR

As a data subject, you have the following rights:

9.1 Right of Access

You may request confirmation of whether your data is being processed and obtain a copy of that data.

9.2 Right to Rectification

You may request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.

9.3 Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)

You may request deletion of your personal data. However, this right can **only be exercised during the curation phase** (before publication). Once a case is published in anonymized form, it is technically impossible to re-identify and delete specific records, as required by Article 11 of the GDPR.

9.4 Right to Object

You may object to the processing of your data for research purposes. If you exercise this right before case publication, the data will be deleted.

9.5 Limitation of Rights

**Important notice:** PPEGC does not maintain any means of re-identifying patients after case publication. Therefore, the rights of access, rectification, and erasure **cannot be exercised on published (anonymized) data**, as permitted under Article 89(2) of the GDPR. These rights may only be exercised during the curation phase by contacting the healthcare institution that submitted your case.

10\. How to Exercise Your Rights

To exercise your data protection rights, please contact:

-   **Your treating physician or the institution that submitted the case** (they will coordinate with PPEGC during the curation phase)

-   **The PPEGC Data Protection Officer:** *dpo@gustaveroussy.fr*

We will respond to your request within **one month** of receipt. You may also lodge a complaint with your national data protection authority (in France: CNIL -- Commission Nationale de l\'Informatique et des Libertés).

11\. International Data Transfers

PPEGC **[does not transfer data]{.underline}** outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Healthcare professionals from countries outside the EEA may submit data to the platform, but such submissions constitute transfers *into* the EU (to Gustave Roussy, France), which is permitted under GDPR without additional safeguards. All data remains within EU jurisdiction at all times.

12\. Data Breach Notification

In the unlikely event of a data breach that poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, PPEGC will notify the relevant supervisory authority (CNIL in France) within 72 hours and, if the risk is high, will inform affected individuals without undue delay.

13\. Patient Information and Consent

Healthcare professionals submitting cases to PPEGC must ensure that patients have been informed of the processing of their data for scientific research purposes in accordance with Article 89 of the GDPR. Patients must be given the opportunity to object to the use of their data. Alternatively, data from deceased patients or patients who are unreachable may be submitted under the legal basis of legitimate scientific interest, provided no prior objection was recorded.

14\. Changes to This Privacy Policy

PPEGC reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in legal requirements or operational practices. The updated policy will be published on the PPEGC website with a revised effective date. Continued use of the platform following such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
