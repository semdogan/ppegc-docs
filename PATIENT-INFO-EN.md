**INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR MEDICAL DATA**

*Platform for Exceptional Genomic Cancer Cases (PPEGC)*

What is PPEGC?

PPEGC is a scientific research platform that collects and shares information about exceptional cancer cases. The goal is to help doctors and researchers around the world better understand how cancer responds to treatment and improve care for future patients.

Why might your case be shared?

Your doctor may wish to share your medical information because your case is **exceptional** --- meaning your response to treatment, your genetic test results, or your side effects are unusual or unexpected. These rare cases can provide important scientific insights.

What information would be shared?

Only the following information would be shared:

-   Your cancer type and stage

-   Your age range (for example, 60-65 years)

-   Your genetic test results (specific gene changes)

-   How your cancer responded to treatment

-   The country or region where you received care

What will NOT be shared?

**[Your personal identity will be protected.]{.underline}** The following information will **[never]{.underline}** be shared:

-   Your name

-   Your date of birth or exact age

-   Your address or the name of your hospital

-   Your medical record number or any other identifying information

Who can access this information?

The anonymized information will be available to doctors, researchers, and scientists worldwide through the PPEGC website. It may help them understand rare cancer cases and develop better treatments.

Your rights

**You have the right to object.** If you do not want your medical information to be shared on PPEGC, please tell your doctor. Your decision will **[not affect your medical care]{.underline}** in any way.

You can object at any time ***before*** your case is published on the platform (usually within 3 months of submission). Once your case is published in fully anonymized form, it cannot be removed because it is no longer possible to identify which case is yours.

How is your data protected?

Your medical data is hosted securely at Gustave Roussy Institute in France, in compliance with European data protection laws (GDPR). All information is encrypted and accessible only to authorized personnel during the review process. Once published, the information is anonymized and cannot be traced back to you.

Questions or concerns?

If you have questions about PPEGC or wish to exercise your right to object, please:

-   **Speak with your doctor or medical team**

-   **Contact the Data Protection Officer:** dpo@gustaveroussy.fr

**YOUR CARE IS OUR PRIORITY**

*Sharing your case information is voluntary and will not affect your treatment or the quality of care you receive.*
