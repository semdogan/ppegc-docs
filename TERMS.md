**PPEGC Terms of Submission**

*Platform for Exceptional Genomic Cancer Cases*

Effective Date: February 14, 2026

1\. Introduction and Acceptance

These Terms of Submission (the **\"Terms\"**) govern the submission of clinical cases to the Platform for Exceptional Genomic Cancer Cases (**\"PPEGC\"**). By submitting a case to PPEGC, you (the **\"Contributor\"**) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the PPEGC Privacy Policy.

**Important:** If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not submit cases to PPEGC. Your submission constitutes acceptance of these Terms in their entirety.

2\. Eligibility to Submit

Only qualified healthcare professionals may submit cases to PPEGC. Eligible contributors include:

-   Licensed physicians (oncologists, pathologists, etc.)

-   Molecular biologists and clinical geneticists

-   Clinical pharmacists with expertise in oncology

-   Academic researchers with access to clinical data

Contributors must provide valid professional credentials (e.g., RPPS, NPI, GMC number) and institutional affiliation at registration. PPEGC reserves the right to verify professional status and reject submissions from unverified contributors.

3\. Definition of Exceptional Cases

PPEGC accepts submissions of exceptional oncological cases associated with genomic alterations. An **\"exceptional case\"** is defined as a clinical situation presenting:

-   **Unexpected therapeutic response:** Complete or durable response to therapy in a context where such outcome is rare or unprecedented

-   **Unexpected resistance:** Primary or acquired resistance to targeted therapy or immunotherapy in the absence of known resistance mechanisms

-   **Unusual toxicity:** Severe or atypical adverse events potentially linked to genomic variants

Cases must be associated with at least one documented genomic alteration. PPEGC reserves the right to reject submissions that do not meet the criteria of exceptionality or scientific interest.

4\. Data Requirements and Quality Standards

4.1 Mandatory Information

Each submitted case must include:

-   **Clinical context:** Cancer type, histology, stage, age range (not exact age), sex, prior treatment lines

-   **Genomic data:** Specific variant(s) in standardized nomenclature (HGVS format), variant allele frequency (VAF), sequencing technique used

-   **Exceptional phenotype:** Clear description of the unexpected clinical response, resistance, or toxicity

-   **Supporting evidence:** Imaging data (anonymized), laboratory results, timeline of events

4.2 Genomic Nomenclature

Genomic variants must be reported using HGVS nomenclature (e.g., *NM_004333.4:c.2369C\>T (p.Thr790Met)*). When available, provide ClinVar or COSMIC identifiers. Submissions with incomplete or non-standard variant annotation may be rejected or returned for correction.

4.3 Germline Variants

Germline (constitutional) variants may be submitted **[only if]{.underline}** they are directly relevant to the exceptional clinical phenotype (e.g., BRCA germline variant associated with unexpected toxicity to platinum therapy). Additional patient consent is required for germline data sharing.

5\. Pseudonymization and Data Protection

5.1 Mandatory Pseudonymization

**[All submitted data must be pseudonymized.]{.underline}** Contributors must remove all direct patient identifiers before submission, including:

-   Patient name, initials, or medical record number

-   Date of birth (replace with age range: e.g., 60-65 years)

-   Precise dates (replace with approximate periods: e.g., Q2 2025)

-   Full address or precise geographic location (country or region only)

-   Photographs or other directly identifying images

5.2 Contributor Responsibility

**The Contributor is solely responsible** for ensuring proper pseudonymization. PPEGC is not liable for any breach of confidentiality resulting from insufficient pseudonymization by the Contributor. Submissions containing direct identifiers will be immediately rejected and may result in suspension of the Contributor\'s account.

6\. Ethical and Legal Compliance

6.1 Patient Information and Non-Opposition

By submitting a case, the Contributor certifies that:

-   **For living patients:** The patient has been informed of the use of their pseudonymized data for scientific research purposes (via institutional policy or PPEGC patient information notice) and has not objected, OR explicit written consent has been obtained and is archived by the Contributor.

-   **For deceased patients:** The patient had not expressed opposition during their lifetime, and the submission complies with local laws regarding posthumous data use.

-   **For unreachable patients:** Reasonable efforts to contact the patient have been made without success, and the submission is justified under the legal basis of legitimate scientific interest (Article 89 GDPR).

6.2 Compliance with Local Regulations

The Contributor certifies compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction, including but not limited to GDPR (EU), HIPAA (USA), LGPD (Brazil), PIPEDA (Canada), and institutional ethics committee approvals where required. **PPEGC does not verify local compliance** and assumes no liability for the Contributor\'s failure to meet legal or ethical obligations.

6.3 Institutional Authorization

If required by the Contributor\'s institution, appropriate authorization or approval for external data sharing must be obtained prior to submission. Contributors employed by institutions with restrictive data-sharing policies are responsible for securing necessary permissions.

7\. Case Review and Curation Process

7.1 Review Timeline

Submitted cases are reviewed by the PPEGC scientific curation team within **7 to 15 business days** of receipt. Contributors will be notified of the review outcome (acceptance, rejection, or request for additional information) via email.

7.2 Acceptance Criteria

Cases are evaluated based on:

-   Scientific exceptionality and novelty

-   Quality and completeness of clinical and genomic documentation

-   Proper pseudonymization and compliance with data protection standards

-   Relevance to the PPEGC mission and community

7.3 Grounds for Rejection

PPEGC reserves the right to reject submissions for the following reasons:

-   Case does not meet criteria for exceptionality

-   Insufficient clinical or genomic documentation

-   Inadequate pseudonymization (presence of identifiable information)

-   Duplicate submission (case already published or under review)

-   Suspected data fabrication or scientific misconduct

Contributors will receive a brief explanation of the rejection and may resubmit after addressing identified deficiencies. Repeated submission of low-quality or non-compliant cases may result in account suspension.

8\. Intellectual Property and Licensing

8.1 Ownership of Submitted Data

The Contributor retains ownership of the original clinical and genomic data. However, by submitting to PPEGC, the Contributor grants PPEGC a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license** to use, reproduce, adapt, publish, and distribute the submitted case in anonymized form for scientific research and educational purposes.

8.2 Public License for Published Cases

Cases published on the PPEGC platform are made available under a **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license**. This allows third parties to access, use, and build upon the data, provided they give appropriate credit to PPEGC and the original Contributor.

8.3 Attribution and Citation
